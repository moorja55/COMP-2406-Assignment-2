Example from:
Mario Casciaro "Node.js Design Patterns" Packt
Chapter 8: Messaging and Integration Patterns

This sample demonstrates how to implement a basic chat application in Node.js
using "raw" web sockets

To try the sample first install the dependencies in package.json by executing:
  >npm install

Then run:
  >node app.js
  
To try the application open several browser instances at the address:
  http://localhost:3000/index.html

Then chat with each other.
